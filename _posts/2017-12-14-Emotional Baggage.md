## Don't feed the troll.

There was someone on my team today who was insulting the team and intentionally attempted to lose the game. This person was extremely upset over a loss they just had, which seems to be typical in online games. Except, these types of reactions are detrimental, if we just had a loss that made us like this, and we went into the next game that agitated, we're probably going to lose again. It creates a snowball effect of negativity and poor, emotionally driven play. As a team, we did not acknowledge the troll and played as a team of 5. After successfully working together and managing to win a couple fights and push an objective, the angry player was not agitated anymore and joined us as a teammate. The tactics illustrated in the post will not only help us stay calm and enjoy games more but also win and improve.

If we're so emotionally invested and attached to a video game, that being able to be tilted and have it affect us, especially for multiple games, is a leak that needs to be repaired. Emotions are unpredictable, they are variables we can control and eliminate when playing a video game or sport. If emotions are something that affects our play, that is a sign of an inconsistent, volatile player, which is the opposite of what we want. We want to be as consistent and reliable as possible, no matter what.

While our leak may be a large one, sometimes we need multiple repairs to completely fix it. The first can be muting the person. It's not exactly a ground-breaking statement, but it seems to be one that is the hardest to follow. We've all been in spots where we've had a real jerk on our team, baiting us in voice chat, and we feel like we need to get even with them, to yell back, or to insult them. Doing this only enlarges the problem, and our leak grows. We've now eliminated part of our leak, engaging the troll. 

Playing the game even with a troll is another way to start fixing our leak. We're on attack on Volskaya Industries and we have one player who chooses Mercy and repeatedly suicides off a ledge. We have some options here, we can scream and ask the enemy team to report them, or we can ignore what they're doing, and focus on winning. Sure, the game is now harder, but winnable. If we sit there like angry children bickering and asking the enemy team to report the troll, we're not focusing on the game, we're not playing to win. Firstly, the enemy team doesn't care about the person on our team, and the second they see our team bickering on all chat, they're chalking this one down as a win. By playing as a unit, albeit one hero down, we can still win, one elimination and it's an even playing field. The Mercy player who was so emotionally agitated from their previous game sees that our team is actually winning, there's a good chance they're going to come try to win after they think they're going to get carried either way.

If after trying both of these, or not succeeding in these tactics, there's always the ultimate decision to just take a break. Read a book on mental fortitude, go for a walk, explore a hobby, etc. Basically, anything but competitive, and ideally, away from the screen for a bit. We've all had gaming sessions when, at the end, we're down for the day, and feel like garbage. Emotions are drained, exhaustion, eyes are strained, etc. we realize that we didn't actually enjoy playing. If we're at a point where all we care about is that +25 SR, and not about improving, we're losing. 

Just remember, that person that is trolling is a variable that can't be controlled by us. However, the way we play *can* be controlled. Imagine in poker if we only played the best hands when we're in the best position, we'd lose all our money to the blinds. We can't wait for the perfect team, we have to work with what we have.

**The takeaway from this is that emotions and Overwatch should be completely mutually exclusive, as in, they're separate from one another.**

In later posts, I will be going into each concept about emotions, how to approach games, and concepts adopted from poker that I think will help anyone who reads and applies them.
